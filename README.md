# Drupal Project List

In the Drupal StackExchange, we find this [question](https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/105571/is-there-a-drupal-org-api-for-retrieving-the-list-of-available-modules) that mentions that there's a big list of projects here,

http://updates.drupal.org/release-history/project-list/all


and that there's a TSV here, 

https://drupal.org/files/releases.tsv

That these files get updated every 4 hours.

This project attempts to archive historical versions of these for exploration by other projects.
